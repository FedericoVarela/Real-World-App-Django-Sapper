# Real World Django + Sapper App

This is a demo website akin to [Real World App](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) that aims to demonstrate the usage of a Django backend and a Sapper frontend.

The backend demo is live [here](https://federicovarela.pythonanywhere.com/)

The frontend is a work in progress and may be subjected to many changes due to the deprecation of Sapper as a whole

This application was also meant as a way for me to practice my web development skills and writing cleaner code, but I'm also hoping it can help other people who are looking for references regarding these technologies, and to provide people who are learning API consumption with another resource to experiment with new technologies
